# Current State of development
## Current demo prompt:
```markdown
Analyze the economic impact of renewable energy adoption in developing countries. Your response should include the following elements:

Summarize the current state of renewable energy adoption in developing countries, focusing on solar and wind power. (summarize)
Compare and contrast the economic benefits and challenges of implementing renewable energy infrastructure in developing vs. developed nations. (analyze)
Generate a short, persuasive paragraph that could be used to encourage policymakers in developing countries to invest in renewable energy. (generate)
Translate the following sentence into French, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese: "Renewable energy is the key to sustainable economic growth." (translate)
Classify the following statement as either "supportive", "neutral", or "skeptical" towards renewable energy adoption: "While renewable energy shows promise, its intermittent nature and high initial costs pose significant challenges for widespread adoption in developing economies." (classify)
Provide a brief overview of recent technological advancements in energy storage that could impact renewable energy adoption in developing countries. (general knowledge)

Please address each point separately and clearly label your responses.

## Current state of development
1. Design and implement the user interface:
   - Create a clean, intuitive Streamlit interface for users to input prompts and view results.
   - [X] done

2. Develop prompt analysis module:
   - Build a system to analyze user input and break it down into smaller, targeted components.
   - [X] done

3. Implement LLM selection logic:
   - Create an algorithm to determine which LLM is best suited for each component of the prompt.
   - [X] done

4. Integrate multiple LLM APIs:
   - Set up connections to various LLM APIs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude3/3.5, Llama) via OpenRouter and handle authentication.
   - using open router this should be relativly simple..
   - [X] done

5. Develop parallel processing system:
   - Create a mechanism to send multiple requests to different LLMs simultaneously.
   - Maybe we need to determine when to use that and when we need to chain llms
   - [X] done

6. Build response collection and synthesis module:
   - Develop a system to gather responses from all LLMs and combine them into a coherent output.
   - hardest part, we need to determine how to combine responses?
   - [ ] done

7. Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms:
   - Create robust error handling for API failures and implement fallback options to ensure reliability.
   - [ ] done

8. Develop a caching system:
   - Implement caching to improve response times for repeated or similar queries.
   - with claude we could use prompt caching on the claude api.. (no open router in this case..)
   - [ ] done

9. Create a feedback loop for continuous improvement:
   - Develop a system to collect user feedback and use it to refine LLM selection and synthesis processes.
   - also very hard task, without data this is impossible.. maybe we need to synthesize data via llm benchmarks
   - [ ] done

10. Optimize performance and scalability:
    - Fine-tune the system for speed and efficiency, ensuring it can handle multiple users and complex queries.
    - [ ] done
